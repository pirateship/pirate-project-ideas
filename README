Space Gambit:

Address the Habitat theme:
Monitor/improve air quality levels within a space.

Assume a closed system
* Track when that assumpton breaks
 * Monitor door traffic
 * Monitor open windows
* Compare measurements in space with measurements outside of space

Create a test for closed space?
* Measure decay of a saturated gaseous substance to judge diffusion coeff
* Repeat with room modifications: door open, heater on/off, etc.

Measure plant health
* Hygrometer to measure soil's water content
* IR + Vis comparison to judge absorbance

Track interacting agents
* Measure biomass of photosynthesizing entities
 * Potted plants
  * Weigh pots without plant
  * Add plant to pots
  * Weight pots over time
  * Measure weight of water prior to watering plant
* Measure biomass of respirating entities
* Measure air/gas mixture (CO2, O2, N2, etc)

Automate plant caretaking?
